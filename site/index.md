## What are the roots of WYSIATI?


**WYSIATI** stands for _“**What You See Is All There Is.**”_ It was coined by psychologist Daniel Kahneman in his book *Thinking, Fast and Slow* to describe a fundamental limitation of human reasoning:

> We tend to make decisions and form judgments based only on the information immediately available to us — and we largely ignore the possibility that there is relevant information we *don’t* see or don’t know.

### 🧠 The Cognitive Shortcut

WYSIATI is a mental shortcut that helps us make quick decisions, but it also explains why we:

* Jump to conclusions
* Are overconfident
* Miss hidden risks or alternatives
* Construct coherent stories from partial facts

### 📌 Example

Suppose you read a glowing review of a new restaurant. It sounds fantastic, and without checking other sources, you decide it must be great. But perhaps the review was written by a friend of the owner. WYSIATI means your mind doesn't demand more data — what you see feels like enough.

### 🔍 Why It Matters

**In decision-making:**

* WYSIATI can cause **overconfidence**: We feel sure about conclusions drawn from incomplete info.
* It feeds into **confirmation bias**: We favor evidence that fits the story we already see.
* It weakens **skepticism**: We don’t naturally ask, “What am I not seeing?”

### 🔧 How to Counter It

1. **Actively seek disconfirming evidence.**
2. **Ask what data is missing.**
3. **Consider multiple perspectives or explanations.**
4. **Use structured reasoning or decision frameworks.**

### 🧠 Kahneman’s Point

Kahneman’s deeper insight is that **System 1** (our fast, intuitive brain) is very good at building stories from little data. It doesn’t like uncertainty. WYSIATI is a side effect: we create meaning from what's in front of us and move on, often without realizing how thin the evidence really was.
